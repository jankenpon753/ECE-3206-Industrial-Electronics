\section*{Theory}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Theory}
In this experiment, we investigate the characteristics of a diode under different load conditions using both DC and AC supplies. The experiment is conducted using simulation software to observe the behavior of the diode in various scenarios.

\subsection*{Diode Characteristics with DC Supply}
When a diode is connected to a DC supply, it exhibits distinct forward and reverse bias characteristics. In forward bias, the diode allows current to flow through it once the applied voltage exceeds the threshold voltage (typically around 0.7V for silicon diodes). The current increases exponentially with the increase in voltage. In reverse bias, the diode blocks current flow, allowing only a very small leakage current until the breakdown voltage is reached \cite{diode_characteristics}.

\subsubsection*{Forward Bias}
In forward bias, the diode's anode is connected to the positive terminal of the DC supply, and the cathode to the negative terminal. The I-V characteristic curve shows a rapid increase in current after the threshold voltage.

\subsubsection*{Reverse Bias}
In reverse bias, the diode's anode is connected to the negative terminal of the DC supply, and the cathode to the positive terminal. The I-V characteristic curve shows a very small current until the breakdown voltage is reached, beyond which the current increases sharply.

\subsection*{Diode Characteristics with AC Supply}
When a diode is connected to an AC supply, it exhibits rectification properties, converting the AC signal into a pulsating DC \cite{ac_supply}.
