\section*{Theory}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Theory}
A three-phase star rectifier is a type of rectifier circuit that converts three-phase AC (Alternating Current) input into DC (Direct Current) output. This type of rectifier is commonly used in industrial applications due to its efficiency and ability to handle high power levels \cite{power_electronics}.
\\\\
In a three-phase star rectifier, diodes are arranged in a star configuration. Each phase of the AC supply is connected to a diode, and the other ends of the diodes are connected together to form the DC output. The rectifier can be used with different types of loads, such as resistive (R) and inductive-resistive (RL) loads \cite{rectifier_design}.
\\\\
When a resistive load is used, the current through the load is in phase with the voltage, resulting in a purely resistive circuit. However, when an inductive-resistive load is used, the current lags behind the voltage due to the inductance, creating a more complex circuit behavior \cite{electrical_machines}.
\\\\
MATLAB/Simulink is a powerful tool for simulating and analyzing the performance of such rectifier circuits. By using MATLAB/Simulink, we can model the three-phase star rectifier and observe the output waveforms for different load conditions. This helps in understanding the behavior of the rectifier and optimizing its performance for various industrial applications \cite{simulink_guide}.

\section*{Observations}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Observations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The output voltage for the R load is a pulsating DC with a frequency 6 times the input AC.
    \item With gate voltage delay for the thyristor and R load, the output voltage shows a delayed conduction angle, reducing the average output.
    \item For the RL load, the output voltage is pulsating DC, with the current lagging due to inductance.
    \item Gate voltage delay for the thyristor with RL load results in a delayed conduction angle and a more pronounced current lag.
    \item MATLAB/Simulink aids in analyzing and visualizing the rectifier's performance under different loads.
