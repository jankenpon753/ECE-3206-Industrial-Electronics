\section*{Theory}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Theory}
In this experiment, the characteristics of a thyristor (SCR) under different load conditions using both DC and AC supplies were investigated using simulation software.

\subsection*{Thyristor Characteristics with DC Supply}
With a DC supply, the thyristor exhibited forward and reverse blocking characteristics. In forward blocking mode, it blocked current until a gate pulse was applied, then conducted until the current fell below the holding current. In reverse blocking mode, it blocked current flow, allowing only a small leakage current until the breakdown voltage was reached \cite{thyristor_characteristics}.

\subsubsection*{R Load}
With a resistive (R) load, the thyristor's behavior is straightforward. When a gate pulse is applied, the thyristor switches to the forward conduction mode, allowing current to pass through the resistive load. The current waveform follows the input voltage waveform, and the thyristor remains on until the current drops below the holding current.

\subsubsection*{RL Load}
With a resistive-inductive (RL) load, the thyristor's behavior is more complex due to the inductance. When a gate pulse is applied, the thyristor switches to the forward conduction mode, and the current through the load increases gradually due to the inductance. The thyristor remains on until the current drops below the holding current, but the inductive load causes the current to continue flowing even after the input voltage drops to zero, resulting in a phase shift between the voltage and current waveforms.

\subsubsection*{Gate Trigger Timing}
The timing of the gate pulse is crucial in controlling the thyristor's conduction. By adjusting the gate trigger timing, the conduction angle of the thyristor can be controlled, which in turn controls the average power delivered to the load. For an R load, the gate pulse timing directly affects the point at which the thyristor starts conducting. For an RL load, the gate pulse timing affects both the conduction angle and the phase shift between the voltage and current waveforms.
