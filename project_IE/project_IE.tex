\section*{Working Principle of Boost Converter}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Working Principle of Boost Converter}
A DC-DC Boost Converter (Step-Up Chopper) is a type of SMPS that increases input DC voltage to a higher output DC voltage using high-speed switching devices.

\subsection*{Circuit Diagrams}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{ckt.png}
    \caption{Basic Circuit Diagram of a DC-DC step up Circuit}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Key Components}
The key components of a boost converter include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An inductor (L)
    \item A switch (typically a MOSFET or IGBT)
    \item A diode (D)
    \item A filter capacitor (C)
    \item A load resistance (R)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Operation Modes}
The operation of a boost converter consists of two intervals in each switching cycle:
\begin{description}
    \item \textbf{ON-State (Switch Closed, $t_1$):}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item The switch is ON, and current flows from the source $(V_s)$ through the inductor, storing energy as a magnetic field.
              \item The diode is reverse-biased, blocking current to the load.
              \item Inductor voltage: \( V_L = V_s \), and current increases linearly: \( \frac{di}{dt} = \frac{V_s}{L} \).
          \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{OFF-State (Switch Open, $t_2$):}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item The switch is OFF, and the inductor releases stored energy.
              \item Current flows through the diode, charging the capacitor and powering the load.
              \item Output voltage: \( V_O = V_S + V_L \), higher than the input.
          \end{itemize}
\end{description}
This cyclical switching process results in a higher average output voltage.

\subsection*{Output Voltage Expression}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{ch1.png}
    \caption{Output Voltage of the Booster Circuit}
\end{figure}

The output voltage of a boost converter is related to the input voltage and the duty cycle \( K \) by
the following equation:
\[
    V_O = \frac{V_S}{1 - K}
\]
Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( V_O \) = Output Voltage
    \item \( V_S \) = Input Voltage
    \item \( K = \frac{t_1}{T} \) = Duty cycle (ratio of ON time to total period)
\end{itemize}
As \( K \) approaches 1 (i.e., longer ON-time), the output voltage increases significantly. However, it
can never be infinite due to practical limitations such as switch losses and component ratings.\cite{lm2577t-adj}

\subsection*{Current Behavior}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{ch2.png}
    \caption{Output Current of the Booster Circuit}
\end{figure}
The inductor current forms a triangular waveform, ramping up during the ON state and down during the OFF state. Proper inductance and switching frequency minimize ripple.\cite{lm2577t-adj}

\section*{Result Discussion}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Result Discussion}
The aim of this project was to design and build a DC-DC step-up (boost) converter using the LM2577-ADJ IC. The circuit was designed and simulated in EasyEDA, and the PCB layout was created following best practices for switching power supplies, including optimized trace routing, decoupling, and component placement. After assembling the PCB and soldering the components, the circuit was tested and verified to operate as expected.\\\\
When powered by a 3.7V lithium-polymer (LiPo) battery, the converter successfully delivered a stable adjustable output voltage ranging from approximately 8V to 72V. This wide range highlights the efficiency of the feedback control loop and the switching process. The onboard potentiometer allowed precise adjustment of the output voltage, while real-time voltage readings were monitored using an external voltmeter/ammeter module connected via header pins.\\\\
During testing, the circuit exhibited stable performance without any thermal or functional issues. The use of a 1N5819 Schottky diode reduced switching losses, and the careful component layout minimized electromagnetic interference (EMI). Additionally, the power indicator LED and output filtering capacitors improved usability and ensured a smooth output voltage.
